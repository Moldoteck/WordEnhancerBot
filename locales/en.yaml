  <b>Bot</b> allows you to replace text in messages with hyperlinks in channels.
  For example if you want to transform this: 
  'Pink Floyd is nice'
  in this:
  '<a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> is nice'
  Follow these steps:
  1. Add the bot to your channel as an admin.
  2. Add the bot to your channel chat as an admin(needed for commands).
  3. In the chat type something like: 
  /addtrig Pink Floyd https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd
  4. Done
  5. To remove it: /rmtrig Pink Floyd
  <b>Send</b> /addtrig to add a new trigger for channel posts.
  <b>Send</b> /rmtrig to remove a trigger for channel posts
